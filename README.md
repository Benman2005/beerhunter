## The Beer Hunter

This React app has a small database of breweries in a json file and searches for them through the google maps api to render them based on distance. Also a map is rendered with markers for all of them, and on the details page you can find details and directions.
You can search beer breweries at https://thebeerhunter.netlify.com/
